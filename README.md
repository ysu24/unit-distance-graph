## üßæ Introduction

This project investigates the **unit distance graph (UDG)**‚Äîa graph in which vertices correspond to points in the plane, and edges represent unit distances between them. Key objectives include:

- Understanding theoretical properties of UDGs.  
- Representing UDGs in the Moser lattice for efficient computation.  
- Maximizing edge counts using advanced techniques like beam search.
